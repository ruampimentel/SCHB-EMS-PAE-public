Yet, a high level of unexplained variability remains after accounting for the role of these factors. This study examined the role of thought disorder, psychological complexity, and interpersonal representations, as measured by the Rorschach, in explaining functional and social skills capacity in 72 middle-aged and older outpatients with schizophrenia (mean age = 51.2 years). Participants responded to the Rorschach administered with the R-Optimized administration instructions and scored with the Rorschach Performance Assessment System. Relationships with neuropsychological performance and psychopathology were also explored. Psychological complexity, which refers to a person's cognitive capacity for problem solving and organizing his or her surroundings, was correlated with functional capacity (r = .30) and social skills capacity (r = .34). Healthy interpersonal representations were correlated with positive social skills (rs = .24–.28). In multiple regression models, psychological complexity accounted for significant variation in functional (β = .23, p = .02) and social skills capacity (β = .35, p < .01) after controlling for neurocognitive functioning and psychopathology. These data suggest that psychological complexity plays a significant role in the functional limitations seen in schizophrenia, above and beyond the contributions of neurocognitive impairment and negative symptoms. Support was also found for the impact of healthy object relations functioning with social functioning. Clinical implications include novel information for future development of cognitive remediation treatment strategies based on a patient's developmental level of psychological capacity and healthy interpersonal schemas.

This investigation addressed the validity of R-PAS measures of psychotic characteristics and psychopathology severity in Taiwan, including the incremental validity of the R-PAS relative to the CS variables measuring the same constructs. Ninety Taiwanese individuals (75 psychiatric patients and 15 nonpatients) were tested with standard R-PAS administration and scoring. Two non-Rorschach severity of disturbance measures and 2 psychosis measures served as independent criterion measures. The R-PAS measures were found to be valid in Taiwan in assessing psychotic symptoms and psychopathology severity, thus demonstrating cultural and linguistic adaptability. Moreover, hierarchical regression analyses demonstrated incremental validity for the R-PAS variables over their CS counterparts, providing support that the R-PAS revisions enhance the test psychometrically. These research findings also demonstrate the viability of the R-PAS as a Rorschach system that can be effectively employed outside the U.S. in a different language and culture.

All studies included the Hare Psychopathy Checklist or one of its versions (Hare, 1980, 1991, 2003) and Exner's (2003) Comprehensive System for the Rorschach. Mean validity coefficients of Rorschach variables in the meta-analysis ranged from −.113 to .239, with a median validity of .070 and a mean validity of .062. Psychopathy displayed a significant and medium-sized association with the number of Aggressive Potential responses (weighted mean validity coefficient = .232) and small but significant associations with the Sum of Texture responses, Cooperative Movement = 0, the number of Personal responses, and the Egocentricity Index (weighted mean validity coefficients = .097 to .159). The remaining 32 Rorschach variables were not significantly related to psychopathy.

Contrary to their assertions, the author suggests why rater agreement should focus on responses rather than summary scores, how field reliability moves away from testing CS scoring principles, and how no psychometric distinction exists between a percentage correct and a percentage agreement index. Also, after reviewing problematic qualities of kappa, a meta-analysis of published data is presented indicating that the CS has excellent chance-corrected interrater reliability (Estimated κ, M = .86, range = .72–.96). Finally, the author notes that Wood et al ignored at least 17 CS studies of test-retest reliability that contain many of the important data they said were missing.

Surveys demonstrate that the Rorschach is extensively used; however, these data are insufficient to demonstrate clinical utility as they do not address the rational, scientific, and ethical requirements of professional standards for psychological measures. After reviewing conceptual issues in Rorschach research (especially those in the Comprehensive System) the authors conclude that there is little scientific evidence to support the clinical utility of the Rorschach. Given the absence of data evaluating how the Rorschach is used in routine practice and whether its use is consistent with the manner in which it is used in research, there is currently no scientific basis for justifying the use of Rorschach scales in psychological assessments.

To expand on their analysis and to respond to issues raised in the previous and current Special Sections, they begin their article by examining a number of conceptual issues that are at the heart of the disagreements about the Rorschach. The focus is then shifted to the central issue of clinical utility, with an emphasis on why current research is insufficient to demonstrate the utility of the Rorschach. Next, the psychometric issues raised by I. B. Weiner (see record 2001-05665-002) are addressed and an alternative perspective on the psychometric viability of the Rorschach is provided. Finally, the authors conclude with some suggestions for future directions that must be taken in research to address the substantive concerns raised by Rorschach critics.

Recent studies suggest that individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) show a lack of global processing bias. In the current study, we examined whether lack of global processing bias affects performance on 2 psychological tests, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale IV (WAIS-IV) and the Rorschach inkblots test, which require the use of visuospatial processing while measuring different psychological constructs. Adult participants (30 ADHD and 30 typically developing controls) completed the subtests of the WAIS-IV, which rely on visuospatial components, and the Rorschach inkblots test. We found no indication of differences in general fluid intelligence between the groups. On the WAIS-IV test, ADHD participants consistently exhibited superior performance on tasks that relied on local processing and inferior performance on tasks that relied on global processing when compared with healthy controls. On the Rorschach inkblots test, ADHD participants exhibited more responses that referred to local aspects (part/s) of the stimulus and fewer responses that referred to global aspects (whole) of the stimulus. These findings imply that when patients with ADHD are given psychological tests that require visuospatial processing, a potential confound of visuospatial processing style needs to be considered.

In an effort to bring greater clarity to the relevant issues, a Special Series was organized for this journal. With the exception of a neutral, meta-analytic review, articles for the Special Series were solicited from scholars known to have opposing views on the Rorschach. The authors agreed to engage in a structured, sequential, and scientifically grounded dialog that focused on strengths and limitations when using the Rorschach in applied clinical settings. The debate takes place over the course of three iterations, with later articles building on and reacting to those generated earlier. This Introduction provides a rationale and overview for the full Special Series. In addition, it briefly describes the five Special Section articles published in this issue of Psychological Assessment. Five additional articles are expected to be published in an upcoming Special Section. In combination, these two Special Sections should provide clinicians, researchers, educators, and students with the most thorough, empirically rigorous, and up-to-date evaluation of the Rorschach's clinical utility.

The research supporting this position is reviewed as are conceptual models that are advantageous to this conceptual position. The authors posit that method variance has a powerful impact on the measurement process. Each method is of value in some areas and of limited relevance in others. Self-report measures are most likely to be useful when interest is focused on consciously available and behavioral dimensions of functioning. Depth-oriented, indirect measures such as the Rorschach are most likely to be useful when interest is focused on unconscious, longitudinal, and structural dimensions of functioning. However, to have a full picture of human beings, heteromethod assessment is necessary to capture the full range of functioning and to implement the analytic model of assessment.

Also, both the number and form level of Rorschach responses can be easily assessed. Other Rorschach variables should be examined for their incremental validity beyond number of responses and form level, or from these variables plus simple MMPI variables. This study applied multiple regression analyses to 2 data sets with reasonable criteria of pathology that were predicted by W. Perry and D. J. Viglione's (see record 1991-26233-001) Ego Impairment Index considered alone. The index had only slight incremental validity over and above the number of responses and form quality, and even less when the average MMPI elevation and L. R. Goldberg's (see record 2011-19214-001) formula for predicting psychosis versus neurosis were entered before these Rorschach variables. Another way of assessing incremental validity is through the use of unit weights, that is, adding standardized variables weighted equally rather than optimally. The unit-weighted incremental validity analysis resulted in the same conclusions.

R. M. Dawes (1999) borrowed 2 previously published data sets to assess the incremental validity of the EII. Dawes determined that in order for the EII to be considered a valid measure, the overall EII score should ""outperform"" 2 of the variables that compose the index. Using this approach, Dawes reported that the EII had ""deficient"" (p = .059) incremental validity. In this study, the incremental validity of the EII was re-examined using 1 of the data sets used by R. M. Dawes (1999). Applying the same strategy as Dawes, the author tested the incremental validity of the EII in predicting positive symptoms of schizophrenia, a more appropriate and clinically relevant criterion measure of impairment. The EII significantly predicted positive symptoms (p < .005) even after the 2 EII variables selected by Dawes and the measure of social competence were 1st entered into the equation. The results suggest that the EII adds meaningful information in the assessment of thought disturbance.

Perry (2001) demonstrate that with a different criterion more incremental validity can be achieved with the Ego Impairment Index than R. M. Dawes (1999) found using the criterion available to him. Attempting to find statistical rationale for various Rorschach characteristics is, indeed, desirable, especially as a basis for the statistical use of the test. The degree of predictability indicated by most of these statistics, however, still presents a sizable gap between well established validity and much practice, particularly in legal settings. Further, both W. Perry (2001) and D. J. Vighone and M. J. Hilsonroth (2001) raise the issue of evaluating incremental validity in a context where there is some degree of multicolinearity and nesting. The logical equivalence of a nested with a non-nested analysis is established algebraically, and it is noted that the standard concerns about multicolinearity involve the estimations of the coefficients of predictive models—not the degree of predictability per se.

Results indicated that participants with Rorschach indicators of dissociation scored significantly higher on the DES than did those without the indicators. Also, incremental changes from 0 to 1 and 1 to 2 Rorschach indicators were associated with increased dissociation as measured by the DES. Viewed from DES measurement of dissociation, Rorschach analogues of dissociation identified a distinctive group that is characterized by strong dissociative tendencies and did not tap the less intense dissociative phenomena common to general psychiatric populations and to nonclinical samples. The Rorschach indicators of dissociation were able to be scored reliably and remained stable at retest. As indirect measures, Rorschach indicators are less subject to distortions stemming from defensiveness or tendencies to manipulate.

M. Dawes, see record 1999-11130-006; J. Hiller et al, see record 1999-11130-005; J. Hunsley and J. M. Bailey, see record 1999-11130-004; G. Stricker and J. R. Gold, see record 1999-11130-002; and D. J. Vigilone, see record 1999-11130-003). Two of the articles provide extensive empirical evidence that the RIM has been standardized, normed, made reliable, and validated in ways that exemplify sound scientific principles for developing an assessment instrument. A 3rd article reports a meta-analysis, indicating that the RIM and the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory have almost identical validity effect sizes, both large enough to warrant confidence in using these measures. The other 2 articles adduce sketchy data and incomplete literature reviews as a basis for questioning the psychometric soundness of Rorschach assessment. Unwarranted skepticism should not be given credence as an adequate platform from which to challenge abundant evidence that the RIM works very well for its intended purposes.

N. Garb et al(see record 2001-05665-003), the authors present the weighted and unweighted means and medians of the effect sizes obtained by J. B. Hiller et al (see record 1999-11130-005). These indices of central tendency are presented separately for MMPI and Rorschach effect sizes, both for all the studies in the meta-analysis and for a 10% trimmed sample designed to obtain more robust estimates of central tendency. The variability of these 4 indices is noticeably greater for the MMPI than for the Rorschach. Meta-analysts must compute, compare, and evaluate a variety of indices of central tendency, and they must examine the effects of moderator variables. The authors also comment briefly on the use of phi versus kappa, combining correlated effect sizes and possible hindsight biases.

This comment is in response to criticism levied by R. M. Dawes (2001; see record 2001-18200-013) on the incremental validity of the Ego Impairment Index (EII), a Rorschach-derived measure of cognition, perception, and reasoning. The Dawes articles (1999 and 2001) serve as an example of the recent practice of placing extraordinary challenges on the Rorschach test. Dawes's arguments are examined and parallel examples are provided that demonstrate the bias used to judge the validity of the EII, the Rorschach, and psychological assessment. Still, in the face of criticism, the results (see Dawes, 2001) support the incremental validity of the EII. Thus, the conclusion presented in this Comment is that it is time for us to ""call the whole thing off"" and end the Rorschach controversy that has occupied so much recent attention and generated so few new ideas.

Nezworski and J. Wood (1995) . Ninety-one patients who were found to meet DSM-IV criteria for an Axis II disorder (Cluster A personality disorders/&=/&10; antisocial/&=/&20, borderline/&=/&25, histrionic/&=/&5, narcissistic [NPD]/&=/&15; Cluster C personality disorders/&=/&16) and 50 nonclinical participants were compared on 5 Rorschach variables: reflection, pair, personalization, idealization, and the egocentricity index. The results of this study indicate that selected Rorschach variables can be used effectively to differentiate NPD patients from a nonclinical sample and from Cluster A, Cluster C, and other Cluster B personality disorders. Also, the reflection and idealization variables were found to be empirically related to DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for NPD and a self-report measure of NPD. Finally, these 2 variables could be used for classification purposes in ways that were clinically meaningful in the diagnosis of NPD.

M. Masling, L. Rabie, and S. H. Blondheim's (1967) Rorschach Oral Dependency (ROD) scale as a measure of interpersonal dependency revealed that this scale has demonstrated good interrater reliability, and that evidence regarding the convergent and discriminant validity of the ROD scale is generally strong. Mixed results have been obtained in studies assessing the internal reliability of ROD scale scores. There have been very few studies examining the predictive validity and retest reliability of the ROD scale, and few studies assessing the relationship of ROD scores to scores on other objective and projective measures of dependency. Implications of these findings for laboratory and clinical research involving the ROD scale are discussed, and suggestions for future studies in this area are offered.
